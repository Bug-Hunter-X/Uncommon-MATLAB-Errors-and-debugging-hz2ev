# Uncommon MATLAB Errors and Debugging
This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur in MATLAB, along with their solutions.  These errors often go unnoticed due to their less frequent occurrence and may confuse developers unfamiliar with MATLAB's implicit behaviors.

## Errors Covered

1. **Implicit Expansion Dimension Mismatch:**  Implicit expansion, a convenient MATLAB feature, can lead to errors if the dimensions of the arrays are not compatible for element-wise operations. This is demonstrated in the code.
2. **Logical Operator Usage:** The difference between the `&` (element-wise AND) and `&&` (short-circuit AND) operators can cause unexpected results if used incorrectly.
3. **Incorrect Indexing:** Attempting to access an element of an array outside its bounds will result in an error.
4. **Colon Operator Behavior:** The colon operator (`:`) can produce unanticipated results under certain circumstances, especially when constructing arrays with irregular steps or ranges.

## How to Reproduce

Clone this repository and run `bug.m`. Observe the errors generated.  Then, examine `bugSolution.m` for solutions and best practices to avoid these issues. 

## Solutions

The `bugSolution.m` file provides corrected code that addresses each of the errors shown in `bug.m`. It demonstrates techniques to perform error checking, dimension validation, correct logical operations, and use indexing safely.
